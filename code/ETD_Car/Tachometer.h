 * Pololu #3542 Romi Encoder connected to Pololu #3543 Motor Driver and Power Distribution Board.
 * This connects motor, power, encoders, and grounds.  Kit includes this hardware.  See images.<br>
 *  Sever VPU = VREG jumper on Motor Driver and Power Distribution Board and connect VPU to 3.3V.<br>
 *  This is necessary because MSP432 inputs are not 5V tolerant.
